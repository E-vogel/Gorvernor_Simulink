# Gorvernor_Simulink

This repository contains a Simulink model and MATLAB script to simulate the dynamics of a governor. The governor is a device used to regulate the speed of a machine, such as an engine.

## Requirements

- MATLAB
- Simulink


## Description

The Simulink model (`governor_simulink.slx`) simulates the dynamics of a governor. The MATLAB script (`governor_sim.m`) is used to animate the results of the simulation. The script visualizes the angular velocity (`omega`) and the opening angle of the governor arms (`phi`) over time.

## Usage

Execute the following command with `governor_simulink.slx` in the same directory

    governor_sim
